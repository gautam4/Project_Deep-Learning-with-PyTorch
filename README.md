# Project_Deep Learning with PyTorch

## Introduction
  This repository includes a series of projects that were created using PyTorch and TensorFlow. Further details on the projects, the data used in the projects, a discussion of the models built and approach taken, and the results and conclusion of each project is available in  the reports included in each project folder.
   
## Project: Image Recognition
  An image classification project involving defining, training, and tuning CNNs to perform a fine-grain classification task. 

## Project Transfer Learning
  An image classification project were classifiers extending ResNet and VGG networks through transfer learning were analyzed for comparative performance.
