# Project Image Recognition

# Introduction 
  
  This project implements and optimizes a CNN to perform a fine-grain classification task. The dataset used for this project involves images of ten different monkey species. The CNN architecture was structurally chosen after multiple trials of different architectures. Once the architecture was chosen, the learning rate was experimented with to optimize network performance. The learning rates were initially decreased by a factor of 10 starting with a learning rate of 0.01 for Trials 1-4. Based on the network performance from these trials, the learning rate was fine-tuned further in Trials 5-7. To achieve an optimal model with this architecture, a model was defined based on the results from Trials 5-7. 
  
# Getting Started 

  The data for this project can be obtained from Kaggle at the below link. The project code was run using Google Colab and therefore, Google Colab was used to upload the dataset.
